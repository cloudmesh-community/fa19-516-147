## AWS Data Pipeline
As per AWS Docs avaible on the aws site (refernce below) 

"AWS Data Pipeline is a web service that you can use to automate the
movement and transformation of data. With AWS Data Pipeline, you can
define data-driven workflows, so that tasks can be dependent on the
successful completion of previous tasks. You define the parameters of
your data transformations and AWS Data Pipeline enforces the logic that
you've set up."
