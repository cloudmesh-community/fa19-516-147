##  Implementation of Data Pipeline & consumtion API
Harsha Upadhyay

## Objective

Objective of this project is to design and implement data pipeline to load CSV data into Cloud environment and make it available for consumption through REST API.

## Design Components 

* Source Data / File residing in cloud or On-prim
* Data pipeline design 
* Target table design (in cloud) 
* REST API design (to surface edata from cloud table and make availble for consumtion )

## Technology Used

* Source : CSV File
* Target Infrastucture : AWS Cloud  & Azure (as project requirements there should two cloud included, will use one which are available free or low cost)
* Target DB : willing to use Aurora or redshift but have to deside based on availability
* API : REST
* Code : Python
* Virtual Config : Cloudmesh
