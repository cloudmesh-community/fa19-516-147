:o: put in url to python api for google in Refernces section

:o: start looking at cloudmesh-cloud cloudmesh/compute/libcloud this is old code and may no longer work you will do the Compute ABC class for google cloud. 

:o: use proper punctioation space rules there is a space after a , . and so on but not before

## Objective

Abstract database management on Multicloud environments for the NIST Big Data Reference Architecture AWS, Azure.

## Introduction

We will be providing database abstractions to host arbitrary databases in arbitrary 
cloud environments. In order to verify that the database provisioning multi cloud 
environment works , we will be providing a detailed test to manipulate data in database. 
This will include standard database functionality.The implementation is being conducted as 
part of API REST services and we will be using following clouds: 

1. Amazon
1. Azure 
1. and Local DB

We will be providing pytest to deploy and execute the verification of the correctness of this services.
