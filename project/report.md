## Objective

Abstract database management on Multicloud environments for the NIST Big Data Reference Architecture AWS, Azure.

## Introduction

We will be providing database abstractions to host arbitrary databases in arbitrary 
cloud environments. In order to verify that the database provisioning multi cloud 
environment works, we will be providing a detailed test to manipulate data in database. 
This will include standard database functionality. The implementation is being conducted as 
part of API REST services and we will be using following clouds: 

1. Amazon
1. Azure 
1. and Local DB

We are providing pytests to deploy and execute the verification of the correctness of this services.

## Cloud Database Services 

Clouding computing is a market emerging trend. It provides on-demand availability of computer system resources, databases , storage etc without direct active management by the user.

When we talk about database , there are two models,
 
1. Traditional cloud model and 
2. Database-as-a-service (DBaaS)

 A cloud database is a database running on a cloud computing platform that could be private, public or hybrid.Cloud database as a service is becoming more and more populer these days because of following main reasons:
 
* no physical infrastructure needed
* can be scaled quickly and efficiently
* mostly self-managed database with less administrative overhead
 
Here is a quick reference table giving the listing of database services options available from cloud services provider market leader ,

## Cloudmesh 

Cloudmesh is a multicloud architecture system which offers single architecture for using multiple cloud provides at the same time.
 
Adbvantage of using cloudmesh is that it not onlyb provides a REST based API but also commandline shell which makes easier to switch between clouds using single variable.


## Architecture

## Technology detail

 * AWS Redshift/ RDS  & Azure SQL Database
 * REST / Open API
 * Python Scripting
 * Cloudmesh

## Implementation Plan 

 ### Step 1: Database Object Creation
   Create Database objects like tables ,views  on a cloud DB (Azure SQL Database )
   Python script to create objects 
 
 ### Step 2: Open API .yaml file
   Create a yaml file 
     * to get database , schema and DDL listing from one cloud environment (e.g Azure or AWS)
     * to create/copy database schema and DDL in other cloude environment 
        
        database.yaml
 ### Step3: Setup Config file
   Create a config file with environment detail for all environment used in the project
   
        cloudmesh.yaml 
  
 ### Step4 : Integration with cloudmesh 
   Set up command line 
  
## Benchmarks

## Conclusion

## Progress
  * Azure account created
  * A database created on Azure SQL Database
  * Docker setup on local
  * Python script to test connection to databse and deploy table
  * AWS account creation
