:o: put in url to python api for google in Refernces section

:o: start looking at cloudmesh-storage  

:o: use proper punctioation space rules there is a space after a , . and so on but not before

## Objective

Abstract database management on Multicloud environments for the NIST Big Data Reference Architecture AWS, Azure.

## Introduction

We will be providing database abstractions to host arbitrary databases in arbitrary 
cloud environments. In order to verify that the database provisioning multi cloud 
environment works, we will be providing a detailed test to manipulate data in database. 
This will include standard database functionality. The implementation is being conducted as 
part of API REST services and we will be using following clouds: 

1. Amazon
1. Azure 
1. and Local DB

We are providing pytests to deploy and execute the verification of the correctness of this services.
