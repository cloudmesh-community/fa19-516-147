Harsha Upadhyay

## Objective

Objective of this project is to design and implement data pipeline to load CSV data into Cloud environment and make it available for consumption through REST API.

## Design Components 

Source Data / File residing in cloud or On-prim
Data pipeline design 
Target table design (in cloud) 
REST API design (to surface edata from cloud table and make availble for consumtion )

## Technology Used

Source : CSV File
Target Infrastucture : AWS Cloud  & Azure (as project requirements there should two cloud included, will use one which are available free or low cost)
Target DB : willing to use Aurora or redshift but have to deside based on availability
API : REST
Code : Python
Virtual Config : Cloudmesh
