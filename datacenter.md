Renewal energy is the alternate form of  energy which is from natural sources and filled up naturally e.g Solar Energy. 
Solar energy is light and heat from the sun which is naturally available .
Solar energy is converted to electricity using solar panels which are installed in the open places where they can receive direct sunlight . 
Photovoltaic cells in the solar panel absorbs sunlight and create direct current (DC) which again get converted to alternate current (AC).
Two most common way of installing solar panels to generate solar energy are Solar Rooftop and Solar Farms. In Solar roof top solution  ,solar panels are installed on top of the house/building where direct sun light can be recived while Solar farms are the open space of land where Solar panels are installed.

One example of data center which use Solar renewable enery is Apple Data center in Maiden NC
